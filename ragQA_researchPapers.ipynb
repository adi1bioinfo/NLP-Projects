            "3.  **Blocking the KDEL-Peptide:** The ultimate function of the SHB, which H12's protonation facilitates, is to secure the ligand within the receptor. The SHB **blocks the C-terminal portion (position -1) of the KDEL-peptide**, trapping it within the receptor. This is the final step in a \"handover pattern\" where the peptide is passed between other residues before being locked in place by the SHB.\n"
