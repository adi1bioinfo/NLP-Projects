ðŸ“– Overview
This project features a sophisticated AI agent that acts as a personal, on-demand food blogger for any city. Instead of relying on a static database, this agent uses the live internet to perform real-time research to answer culinary questions. Ask it for the best local dishes, hidden gems, or specific restaurants, and it will find, synthesize, and present the information in a structured format.

The primary code and detailed explanations are available in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.
